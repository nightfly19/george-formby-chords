Intro:
C              G7         C       G7     C
I can read the future and tell if fate's unkind.
G                        G7               D7             G7 Gsus2 G7
The stars I've read I've looked ahead and this is what I find

Verse:
C             G7     A7                   Dm             G7    C (C6) (C)
Climbing last week a big mountain peak, I slipped down a rocky slope
  A7                   D7                                    G7  C
I cried as I fell "I'm on my way to bed, I can tell it by my horoscope".

My brother joe pulled a wishbone with Flo, and said "for the best, lets hope"
Then he whispered, "Ooh! Me wish is coming true, I can tell it by my horoscope".

Chorus:
E7            E7+5 E7  Am            E7    E7+5 E7 Am
There's lucky colours, lucky stones, lucky numbers too.
G              G7                D7     D    D7 G7
Lucky eight as sure as fate will always pull me through.

Verse:

My cousin Kate is putting on weight, I said "You're beyond all hope.
Nature's unkind, your futures all behind, I can tell it by your horoscope".

Once an old maid, said "I'm afraid. My future brings no hope"
I said "Don't give way! The troops are home today, I can tell it by your horoscope".

Early one morn, a baby was born. It's father said "Plase don't mope.
Lets jump for joy, I know that it's a boy, I can tell it by his horoscope"

CHORUS

I study stars, Venus and Mars, for Venus there isn't much hope.
She's all wrapped in gauze with a pair of flannel socks I can tell it by her horoscope.

Extra verses:

Snowstorms and hails, blizzards and gales, through fog away we grope
but next July its going to be dry I can tell it by my horoscope

Said Grandpa so gay, mixed bathing one day "With Flappers I still can cope"
I'm older in years but I've got some young ideas, I can tell it by my horoscope
